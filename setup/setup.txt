Use Raspberry Pi imager to set up SD card, and configure:
 - Hostname
 - Default user
 - Enable SSH
 - Configure WiFi 

Alternatively, for WiFi and SSH:
 - Copy wpa_supplicant.conf and ssh to the FAT32 partition of your Raspberry Pi SD card before turning it on for the first time.
 - Make sure you edit wpa_supplicant.conf to contain your network details first.
 

sudo apt-get install python3-dev

To use the X-Air API, we need to build a newer version of Python than comes 
with the default Raspberry PI OS.

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential tk-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline6-dev libdb5.3-dev libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/Python-3.11.1.tgz
tar -zxvf Python-3.11.1.tgz
cd Python-3.11.1.tgz
./configure --enable-optimizations
make
sudo make altinstall

Then create the virtual environment using Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv software/.venv
